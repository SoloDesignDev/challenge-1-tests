# Challenge 1 Tests â€“ Calculator

This repository contains the test suite used to validate student submissions for the **calculator** challenge on Codelab.

Each stage corresponds to a file in `tests/`:

- Stage 1: test addition
- Stage 2: test subtraction
- Stage 3: test multiplication
- Stage 4: test division

The pod runner clones the student repo and executes only the test script for the current stage.
